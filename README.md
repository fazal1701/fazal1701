## Overview

I design and ship **production-grade AI systems** that integrate into real products and solve real operational problems.

My work spans **system architecture, applied data science, machine learning, and full-stack engineering**, with a focus on clarity, reliability, and systems that can be understood, monitored, and evolved.

I specialize in turning **ambiguous requirements into explicit systems**—clear data flows, defined boundaries, data-driven metrics, known failure modes, and measurable outcomes.  
The goal is not experimentation for its own sake, but **systems that hold up under production constraints** such as latency, cost, correctness, and user trust.

**Industries:** Financial Services & Banking · E-commerce & Retail · Healthcare · Hospitality · Consumer Marketplaces

## What I Build

### Agentic & Multi-Step AI Systems
Multi-agent workflows with deterministic and probabilistic paths, tool invocation, retrieval integration, state management, and cost-aware routing.

Used in domains where **correctness matters more than autonomy**:
- KYC automation  
- Decision support  
- Document workflows  
- Operational triage

### Document Intelligence Platforms
End-to-end document understanding systems:
- OCR → extraction → validation → routing  
- Confidence scoring and escalation  
- Human-in-the-loop review  

Applied to underwriting, claims, legal review, and investment analysis.

---

### Ranking, Retrieval & Recommendation Systems
Real-time systems combining:
- Embeddings  
- Behavioral signals  
- Business constraints  

Designed for:
- Personalized feeds  
- Search ranking  
- Discovery and conversion surfaces  

Includes evaluation frameworks and controlled experimentation.

### Cloud-Native ML Inference
Production inference systems with:
- Autoscaling  
- Canary deployments  
- Latency monitoring  
- Rollback strategies  

Built to support rapid iteration **without destabilizing production**.

---

### Decision Intelligence & Forecasting
Feature stores, semantic models, and forecasting pipelines with uncertainty awareness.

Used for:
- Pricing  
- Risk  
- Planning  
- Executive decision support  

---

## Full-Stack AI Product Engineering

I build end-to-end AI products across **backend, web, and mobile**, focusing on production reliability and real user impact.

- **Web:** React and Next.js dashboards, admin surfaces, AI-driven workflows  
- **Mobile:** React Native and Expo applications for consumer and internal use  
- **APIs:** TypeScript and Python services with explicit, versioned contracts  

Frontend is treated as part of system design, particularly where UX influences trust, adoption, and model performance.

## Data & Knowledge Systems

- Vector-based retrieval with hybrid search and reranking  
- Schema design for documents, chunks, metadata, and hierarchy  
- Knowledge graphs for entity resolution and relationship-aware reasoning  
- Graph-backed AI systems for explainability and richer context

## How I Work

- **Architecture first:** clear diagrams, data models, explicit tradeoffs  
- **Vertical slices:** thin end-to-end paths that prove value early  
- **Production discipline:** known failure modes and observability from day one

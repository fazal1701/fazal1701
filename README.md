## Selected Projects

- **Autonomous Agentic Workflow Orchestration**  
  Designs and coordinates multi-step AI systems by managing agents, tools, state, and human-in-the-loop decisioning.

- **Real-Time Multimodal Recommendation & Ranking**  
  Search, discovery, and personalization systems combining embeddings, behavioral signals, and business constraints.

- **Cloud-Native ML Inference Platform**  
  Scalable model serving infrastructure with monitoring and safe rollout mechanisms to support production ML at scale.

- **Enterprise Decision Intelligence Engine**  
  Transforms structured and unstructured data into forecasts, KPIs, and executive-level decision support.

- **Fashion Multimodal Aesthetic Intelligence Engine**  
  Models visual similarity, aesthetics, and style using image–text embeddings to power creative discovery and recommendations.

- **Document Intelligence Pipeline**  
  Converts unstructured documents into validated, structured signals using OCR, extraction, and human-in-the-loop review.

Systems are designed for production workloads, real-time latency, and operational reliability.  
Each repository includes architecture diagrams, tradeoff analysis, and benchmarks.

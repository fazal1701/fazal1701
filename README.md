I design and ship **production-grade AI platforms** that integrate into real products and solve real operational problems.

My work spans **system architecture, applied machine learning, and full-stack engineering**—with a focus on clarity, reliability, and systems that can be understood, monitored, and evolved.

I specialize in turning vague requirements into **explicit, well-scoped systems**: clear data flows, defined boundaries, known failure modes, and measurable outcomes.  
The goal is not endless experimentation, but **systems that hold up under production constraints**—latency, cost, correctness, and user trust.

**Industries:** Financial Services · Healthcare · E-commerce · Retail · Enterprise Operations

## What I Build

### Agentic & Multi-Step AI Systems
Multi-agent workflows with deterministic and probabilistic paths, tool invocation, retrieval integration, state management, and cost-aware routing.

Designed for domains where correctness matters more than autonomy:
- KYC automation
- Decision support
- Document workflows
- Operational triage

---

### Document Intelligence Platforms
End-to-end document understanding systems:
- OCR → extraction → validation → routing
- Confidence scoring and escalation
- Human-in-the-loop review

Applied to underwriting, claims, legal review, and investment analysis.

---

### Ranking, Retrieval & Recommendation Systems
Real-time systems combining:
- Embeddings
- Behavioral signals
- Business constraints

Designed for:
- Personalized feeds
- Search ranking
- Discovery and conversion surfaces  
With evaluation frameworks and controlled experimentation.

---

### Cloud-Native ML Inference
Production inference systems with:
- Autoscaling
- Canary deployments
- Latency monitoring
- Rollback strategies

Built to support rapid iteration **without destabilizing production**.

---

### Decision Intelligence & Forecasting
Feature stores, semantic models, and forecasting pipelines with uncertainty awareness.

Used for:
- Pricing
- Risk
- Planning
- Executive decision support

---

## Full-Stack AI Product Engineering

I work across **backend, web, and mobile** where AI systems deliver real value.

- **Web:** React / Next.js dashboards, admin tools, AI-driven workflows
- **Mobile:** React Native / Expo for consumer and internal apps
- **APIs:** TypeScript & Python services with explicit contracts

Frontend is part of system design—especially where UX impacts trust, adoption, or model effectiveness.

## Data & Knowledge Systems

- Vector-based retrieval with hybrid search and reranking
- Schema design for documents, chunks, metadata, and hierarchy
- Knowledge graphs for entity resolution and relationship-aware reasoning
- Graph-backed AI systems for explainability and richer context

---

## Technical Foundation

**Languages:** Python · TypeScript · SQL · Cypher  
**Frameworks:** FastAPI · Node.js · React · Next.js · React Native  
**AI Stack:** Azure OpenAI · LangChain · LangGraph · Hybrid RAG  
**Data:** PostgreSQL · Neo4j · Vector DBs (pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate)  
**Cloud:** AWS · Azure · GCP  
**Infrastructure:** Docker · Kubernetes · Terraform · CI/CD  
**Observability:** OpenTelemetry · Metrics · Distributed Tracing · Alerting

---

## How I Work

- **Architecture first:** Clear diagrams, data models, explicit tradeoffs
- **Vertical slices:** Thin end-to-end paths that prove value early
- **Production discipline:** Known failure modes and observability from day one
